<h4>NBR</h4>
<p>
The Normalized Burn Ratio(NBR) index highlights burned areas in large fire zones greater than 500 acres. The formula is similar to a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), except that it uses near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (Lopez, 1991; Key and Benson, 1995).
Notice that the indicate burned areas in the Normalized Burn Ratio images.
