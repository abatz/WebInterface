<h4>SPI/SPEI</h4>
<p>
The  Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI; McKee 1993) is calculated using only monthly precipitation.
SPI is based on the probability of recording a given amount of cumulative precipitation over a consecutive number of months. 
The probabilities are standardized so that an index of zero indicates the median precipitation amount, with a negative index for drought and a positive index for wet conditions. As the dry or wet conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or more positive. Specifically, the SPI is calculated for each month by accumulating the precipitation for the previous x-number of months and comparing the values to the climatological average to obtain a normalized measure of how anomalous the amounts were. This is done for each month of year and can be applied across any given duration period of x-months.  One advantage of SPI is that it is multiscalar, meaning the transformation can be done on a range of timescales for us in both short-term and long-term drought. A caveat in using SPI is that it fails to account for the sequencing of precipitation and PET relative to soil water dynamics and do not account for snow. 
The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI,) is calculated in the same way as SPI except that it considers monthly precipitation minus evapotranspiration (PET).
