Drought is a complex process that has adverse effects on society, primarily through degradation of agricultural crops, depletion of water resources, and increased wildfires. In recent years, the contigous United States (CONUS) has experienced several devastating droughts. California experienced its driest calendar year in recorded history in 2013, with severe drought conditions persisting at the present time. 
In 2011, Texas experienced extreme precipitation deficits; while in both 2011 and 2012 record breaking temperatures and high wind speed played a significant role in drought intensification over much of the central United States. While conditions in Texas in 2011 deteriorated over the course of a year, the depletion of moisture over the central U.S. occurred at a much faster rate, which has been termed “flash drought”. Flash droughts have been largely neglected from traditional drought monitoring. However, given the widespread agricultural losses associated with the 2012 event, there is a growing need for implementation and robust visualization of physically based drought indices that capture important land surface-atmospheric feedbacks.

It has been common practice in recent decades to monitor ongoing drought and analyze historical drought using metrics driven by precipitation and temperature only. The two most commonly used indices are the Palmer Drought Severity Index(PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). While these metrics have proven useful for providing valuable information regarding hydrologic and meteorological drought, they have serious limitations at short time scales (weekly) and fail to identify drying associated with atmospheric variables other than precipitation and temperature (e.g. humidity, wind speed, and downwelling shortwave radiation). The most heavily used tool for decision making with regards to drought is the U.S. Drought Monitor, which relies on a blend of drought metrics and climate data to produce weekly maps of drought severity that are representative of monthly average conditions.

More recent studies have shown that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration, obtained through the use of remote sensing, to evaporative demand (Eo) can be used as a drought indicator (Anderson et al. 2011). However, some limitations with remote sensing exist such as lack of available near real-time data, and problems with satellites “seeing” the surface when cloudy conditions exist. In an effort to overcome some of the limitations of the aforementioned drought indices, Hobbins et al. (2011) developed the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI), which relies on physically based Eo derived from freely available near real-time National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) gridded weather data of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and downwelling shortwave radiation, currently housed on the GEE cloud. The use of a physically based Eo, as opposed to a temperature based has been proven to better capture wet and dry periods at both long and short time scales due to the reliance of land surface and atmospheric feedbacks (Hobbins et al. 2012; Huntington et al., 2011; Sohrabi et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been shown that EDDI can serve as an effective early warning signal for identifying the onset of a flash drought, and can provide valuable information as a near real-time drought monitoring tool (Hobbins et al., 2012). Another advantage of multi-scalar drought indices such as SPI and EDDI, is the flexibility to allow for user specified aggregation periods so that extended hydrologic drought or flash droughts can be easily identified by selecting longer or shorter time scales (McEvoy et al., 2012; McEvoy et al., 2014).

This website provides a tool for calculating both traditional and new state-of-the-art drought metrics in near real time using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing framework with retrospective and forecasted climate. With the interactive tool, useres have full control of selecting drought indices, time scales for analysis and the ability to dynamically visualize map and time series results by zooming, panning and controlling display scales.
