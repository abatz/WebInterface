<h4>BAI</h4>
<p>
The Burn Area Index (BAI) highlights burned land in the red to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, by emphasizing the charcoal signal in post-fire images. The index is computed from the spectral distance from each pixel to a reference spectral point, where recently burned areas converge. 
Notice that the brighter pixels in the Burn Area Index images indicate burned areas. 
BAI is computed as follows (Mart√≠n, 1998):
