<div class="infowindow"><h4>Drought Impacts from California Snowpack</h4> <table><tr><td><p>The runoff from the snowpack of the Sierra Nevds in California is a key source of water for California communities and growers, accounting for about one-third of the states water. The final measurement of the wet season showed the snowpack at 18 percent of average for the state. The April 1st measurement of the snowpack, considered the peak of the snow season, showed that the 2014 snowpack was about 32 percent of average water content. <br><br>A poor snowpack measurement spells problems for the entire state with hot and dry summer months ahead.The lack of water this year has meant that farmers have fallowed tens of thousands of acres - fields left unsown to restore fertility-and that affects how many workers they employ.  </p></td><td><img src="images/CA_snowpack.jpg" height="100px"></td></tr></table> </div>
