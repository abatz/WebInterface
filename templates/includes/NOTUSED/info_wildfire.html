<div class="infowindow"><h4>Drought Impacts on California Wildfires</h4> <table><tr><td><p>One measure of the California Drought situation for 2014 is the Energy Release Component, which is a measure of the potential fuel there is to burn given the dryness of the vegetation. As shown here, the Energy Release Component for the northern portion of the Central Valley (i.e. Redding, Chico) was the highest on record from 1979. Given the dryness of the fuels all over the area, it is not too surprising that several lightning ignited fires burned in Northern California in the Summer of 2014. <br><br>The impacts of  wildfires on humans is not only from the loss of forest resources and endangerment of houses/lives, but is also in the reduced air quality as weather systems move the smoke from wildfires all over the region. </p></td><td><img src="images/CA_Wildfires.jpg" height="100px"></td></tr></table> </div>
